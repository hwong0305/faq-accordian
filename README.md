# faq-accordian

This project is a small twist on a FrontEnd Mentor [Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-card-XlyjD0Oam).

I added a smal twist on my side since I didn't bother downloading the material. I used this to experiment how to write an accordian using Vanilla JS and no libraries.
This is hosted with Snowpack.
